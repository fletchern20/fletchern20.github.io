        <p1>For our final project, Aaron and I created a working blackjack game using javascript coding that we have learned throughout the semester. Blackjack is a popular card game, where people bet money and try to beat their opponent or the dealer. The goal of blackjack is to beat the opponents's hand without going over 21. Face cards are worth 10, aces are worth 11, and every other card is worth its number. Each player is allowed to 'Hit', which is to ask for another card. If you go over 21 you bust, and your opponent wins. Our game makes it very simple, it is a two player game so each person takes turns. At first each player decides how much they want to bet, and then they take turns playing their hand and at the end the winner collects.</p1>
